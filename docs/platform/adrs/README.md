# ADRs

We use ADRs (**Architectural Decision Records**) to document important architectural decisions.

These documents start as Drafts in a [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XYxE13GP6JjlRVyoSg1PEOtDrriq\_frT), with a status “proposed”, where we can describe all available options. Sometimes the options are only two, the one suggested and the current one.

Based on discussions in Refinement sessions or ad-hoc meetings, we make a decision and if it’s accepted then:

1. Document that in the "Decision Outcome" section of the document.
2. Change its status to "accepted" (or "declined" or just "decided").
3. Make a copy of the document here (see next pages) for visibility reasons.

All the pending ADRs are in our [ADR Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XYxE13GP6JjlRVyoSg1PEOtDrriq\_frT).
