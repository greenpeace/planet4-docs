# ADRs

We use ADRs \(**Architectural Decision Records**\) to document important architectural decisions.

These documents start as Drafts in a [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WyI5qWVHPvavO6HaTEr8xKyWPX8ZgC1p), with a status “proposed”, where we can describe all available options. Sometimes the options are only two, the one suggested and the current one.

Based on discussions in Refinement sessions or ad-hoc meetings, we make a decision and if it’s accepted then:

1. Document that in the "Decision Outcome" section of the document.
2. Change its status to "accepted" \(or "declined" or just "decided"\).
3. Make a copy of the document here \(see next pages\) for visibility reasons.

All the pending ADRs are in our [ADR Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WyI5qWVHPvavO6HaTEr8xKyWPX8ZgC1p).
