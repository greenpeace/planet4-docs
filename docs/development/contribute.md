## Development

Planet 4 mainly consists of two repositories, for the theme and the blocks plugin. Both share code from our styleguide.

* [planet4-master-theme](https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-master-theme)
* [planet4-plugin-gutenberg-blocks](https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-plugin-gutenberg-blocks)

Depending on what issue you are working on, you should fork it on Github.

## Pull Requests

Before working on something or opening a Pull Request, please make sure that there is a relevant issue:

* If a relevant issue already exists, leave a comment that you are interested in working on that.
* If no relevant issue exists, open a new one and initiate the discussion.

We use the [planet4](https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4/issues) repository to track tickets that are open for contribution.

All Pull Requests should target the `main` branch. Make sure to reference the relevant issue in your Pull Request description and follow our [git guidelines](git-guidelines.md).

## Coding

In general we try to stick as close as possible to [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/). The best approach to make sure your code is following planet4â€™s coding style is to use code linters. Most code editors have integrations and plugins for linting the code in realtime. We already have linter configuration in our repositories. Here is a list of the linters we use:

* PHP: [PHP\_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP\_CodeSniffer)
* Javascript: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
* CSS/Sass: [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)

## Code Of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive and welcoming environment, our project is following a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct).
