# Installation

We are using [`wp-env`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/packages/env/README.md) as a base and pulling all necessary themes and plugins so that you can develop for your website more easily.

### System Requirements

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/)
* [node/npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
* curl
* _optional:_ [_gcloud_](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud)

#### Platform specific steps

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Linux" %}
Install basic system dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install -y git make unzip apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
```

Install docker and docker-compose. We prefer to install it from upstream, to have the latest version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository -y "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Add your user to the `docker` group to avoid using `sudo` on every command:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

Refresh your group membership by running:

```bash
su - ${USER}
```

To verify that everything works you can just run the hello-world docker container:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}
In order to run the Planet4 development environment in Windows you'll need to enable **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**. WSL allows you to run a Linux environment within Windows. You'll need to enable WSL and install Ubuntu. The current version (WSL 2) comes with a lot of enhancements and better disk performance.\
\
You can follow the installation instructions [here](https://ubuntu.com/wsl).

[Here is a post](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/a-linux-dev-environment-on-windows-with-wsl-2-docker-desktop-and-more) with some more detail about setting up WSL 2 (and many other tips for Windows devs!)

Note: this guide was created using the Ubuntu 20.04 image.

**Verify WSL 2 and the Ubuntu image are installed**

From a Powershell window, run this command to see the installed distros:

```bash
wsl -l -v
```

You should see the distro you installed in the list, with the WSL version: `Ubuntu 20.04 - 2`

#### Make sure WSL is enabled

Look here for more details. and set version for a specific distribution:

```bash
wsl --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2
```

#### Install docker

Follow official documentation on [Docker on WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers).

#### Troubleshooting

In case the WSL version for your distro is 1, you can update it using:

```bash
wsl --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2
```

sudo pip3 install -IUq docker-compose

```bash
The command 'docker-compose' could not be found in this WSL 2 distro.
We recommend to activate the WSL integration in Docker Desktop settings.
```

See [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/) for details.

### Before anything

* Clone the develop repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-develop/
```

* Set node version:

```bash
# nvm will automatically select the right version based on the `.nvmrc` file
nvm use
```

* Install npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

* Check the requirements:

```bash
npm run env:requirements
```



### Installation

Install default developer environment with:

```
npm run env:install
```

#### NRO environment

For NRO developers, use instead:

```bash
# NRO name is the name used for your deployment repo (repo -> name to use):
# planet4-international -> international
# planet4-australiapacific -> australiapacific
npm run nro:install <nro name>
```

### Clean up

```
npm run env:clean
```

### Workflow

* Themes are installed under `planet4/themes`
  * the theme is usually cloned by the installer and should be modifiable right away
  * you can add or create any theme in this folder, it will be available in your local instance
* Plugins are installed under `planet4/plugins`
  * you can add or create any plugin in this folder, it will be available in your local instance
